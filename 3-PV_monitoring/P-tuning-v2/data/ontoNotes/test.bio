Uh-huh	O

However	O

it	O

not	O

when	O
an	O

is	O
sent	O

inform	O
citizens	O
of	O
such	O
an	O

of	O

Yes	O

this	O
is	O
indeed	O
through	O

very	O
successful	O

this	O

ah	O

by	O
Beijing	B-ORG

,	O
Uh-huh	O

an	O
extremely	O
good	O
point	O
that	O
is	O
worth	O
pondering	O
deeply	O
,	O
worthy	O
innovation	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
previously	O
our	O
news	O
announcements	O
were	O
made	O
through	O
some	O
conventional	O
methods	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O
mobile	O

In	O

,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
method	O
highly	O

in	O
various	O

of	O
e-government	O

We	O
usually	O
make	O
it	O
sound	O
like	O
e-government	O
is	O
something	O
unattainable	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
talked	O
about	O
e-government	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
only	O
done	O
through	O
the	O
Internet	O

Right	O

It	O
seemed	O
that	O
computers	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Internet	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
were	O
an	O
expression	O
of	O
e-government	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
people	O
find	O
out	O
information	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
presently	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
e-governments	O
in	O
various	O
countries	O
apply	O
this	O
so	O
-	O
called	O
last	O
multiple	O

method	O

such	O
as	O

such	O
as	O
electronic	O
IDs	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
as	O
,	O
these	O
electronic	O

These	O
are	O
quite	O
sophisticated	O
forms	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
more	O
terminals	O
,	O
such	O
as	O

this	O

ah	O
,	O
and	O
mobile	O

SMS	O
,	O
are	O
applied	O
in	O
e-government	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
,	O
a	O
test	O
of	O
e-government	O
because	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
during	O
SARS	O
in	O
2003	B-DATE
,	O
people	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
criticized	O
e-government	O
during	O
the	O
spread	O
of	O
SARS	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
e-government	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
put	O
into	O
use	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
short	O
SMS	O
like	O
this	O
can	O
fully	O
create	O
interaction	O
between	O
the	O
government	O
and	O
the	O
public	O
through	O
this	O
e-government	O
form	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

We	O
drive	O
often	O
in	O
Beijing	B-GPE
,	O
ha	O

Yang	B-PERSON
Yang	I-PERSON

If	O
people	O
were	O
not	O
informed	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
traffic	O
accident	O
through	O
SMS	O
on	O
that	B-DATE
day	I-DATE
and	O
they	O
continued	O
to	O
head	O
there	O
,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
would	O
happen	O
if	O
people	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O
and	O
the	O
jam	O
did	O
not	O
clear	O
?	O

Yes	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
real	O
paralysis	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
appropriate	O
word	O
to	O
use	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
when	O
SMS	O
was	O
used	O
to	O
announce	O
the	O
news	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
fit	O
the	O
conditions	O
in	O
our	O
China	B-GPE
very	O
well	O
.	O

Why	O
is	O
that	O
so	O
?	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
China	B-GPE
is	O
the	O
country	O
with	O
the	O
highest	O
SMS	O
usage	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
probably	O
not	O
as	O
many	O
chances	O
to	O
use	O
SMS	O
in	O
foreign	O
countries	O
compared	O
with	O
domestically	O
,	O
in	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
ah	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
penetration	O
was	O
quite	O
high	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
by	O
using	O
the	O
most	O
familiar	O
method	O
,	O
most	O
used	O
by	O
everyone	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
prompt	O
and	O
most	O
convenient	O
method	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
announcement	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
many	O
friends	O
,	O
around	O
me	O
received	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
that	O
almost	O
everyone	O
received	O
this	O
SMS	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

The	O
effect	O
was	O
extremely	O
good	O
,	O
ha	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
how	O
exactly	O
did	O
citizens	O
react	O
?	O

Let	O

what	O
do	O
you	O

I	O
set	O

we	O

Yes	O

a	O

So	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
first	B-ORDINAL
turn	O
our	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
impact	O
on	O

after	O
the	O

Judging	O
from	O
the	O
traffic	O
control	O
measures	O
taken	O
after	O
the	O
accident	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O

,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
are	O
the	O
effects	O
?	O

Actually	O
,	O
concerning	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
both	O
of	O
you	O
are	O
very	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
traffic	O
in	O
Beijing	B-GPE
.	O

Previously	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
statistic	O
,	O
especially	O
for	O
the	O
ring	O
roads	O
in	O
Beijing	B-GPE

That	O
is	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
have	O
an	O
ordinary	O
fender	O

or	O

accident	O
on	O
a	O
bridge	O
such	O
as	O
the	B-FAC
Jingguang	I-FAC
Bridge	I-FAC
of	O
the	B-FAC
Third	I-FAC
Ring	I-FAC
Road	I-FAC
,	O
it	O
might	O
cause	O
the	O
entire	O
Third	B-FAC

to	O
have	O
bumper	O

during	O
these	O
morning	O
and	O
evening	O
peak	O
periods	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O

It	O
might	O
even	O
impact	O
traffic	O
on	O
the	O
Second	B-FAC

Road	I-FAC
and	O
Fourth	B-FAC

Well	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
accident	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
occurs	O
until	O
the	O
time	O
all	O
traffic	O
is	O
cleared	O
,	O
it	O
probably	O
takes	O
about	B-TIME
half	I-TIME
an	I-TIME
hour	I-TIME
to	I-TIME
an	I-TIME
hour	I-TIME
during	O
peak	O
periods	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
imposing	O
temporary	O
traffic	O
restriction	O
measures	O
on	O
a	O
long	O
section	O
of	O
road	O
stretching	O
from	O
Jingguang	B-FAC

to	O
Changhong	B-FAC

from	O
the	O

all	O

to	O
Guomao	B-FAC
Bridge	I-FAC
,	O
blocking	O
the	O

Well	O
,	O
the	O
situation	O
would	O
be	O
unthinkable	O
during	O
this	O
peak	O
period	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
first	B-ORDINAL

at	O

people	O

the	O

indeed	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

Uh-huh	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
affected	O

was	O
not	O
as	O
large	O
as	O
expected	O

Moreover	O
,	O
some	O
people	O
made	O
detours	O
once	O
they	O
received	O
the	O

Right	O

Psychologically	O

people	O
felt	O

Because	O
I	O

Right	O
,	O
like	O
those	O

It	O
was	O

once	O

Yes	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
,	O
a	O

That	O

even	O

.	O

Right	O
.	O

Actually	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
aspect	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O

were	O
really	O

For	O

,	O
this	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O

received	O
an	O

A	O

12th	B-ORDINAL

at	O
the	B-FAC
Guomao	I-FAC

,	O
ah	O

We	O
were	O
discussing	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
go	O
home	O
in	O
fewer	O

since	O
everyone	O
was	O
on	O
the	O

.	O

Later	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
suggested	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
you	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
take	O
the	O
subway	O
,	O
because	O
you	O
can	O
directly	O

the	O

you	O

Right	O

Hey	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
this	O
was	O
quite	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O

Actually	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
everyone	O
was	O
quite	O
cooperative	O
and	O
also	O
quite	O

in	O
this	O

.	O

Yes	O
,	O
many	O

where	O

the	O

Ah	O

we	O
can	O
take	O
a	O
look	O
later	O
through	O
an	O

This	O

a	O

with	O

Chaoyang	B-FAC

Whether	O

East	B-FAC
Third	I-FAC
Ring	I-FAC
Road	I-FAC
in	O

,	O
as	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
from	O
this	O
diagram	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
area	O
at	O
the	O
main	O
and	O

roads	O
of	O
East	B-FAC
Third	I-FAC
Ring	I-FAC
Road	I-FAC
normally	O
has	O
quite	O
heavy	O
traffic	O
,	O
especially	O
during	O
commuting	O
times	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Chaoyang	B-FAC
Road	I-FAC
is	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
artery	O
in	O
the	O
east	O

west	O

.	O

Yes	O

When	O
people	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
west	O
want	O
to	O
cross	O
over	O
from	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
via	O
this	O
road	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
if	O
a	O
traffic	O
accident	O
occurs	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
indeed	O
imagine	O
,	O
ha	O
,	O
how	O
widespread	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
impact	O
will	O
be	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
cars	O
caught	O
in	O
traffic	O
jams	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
actually	O
I	O
think	O
everyone	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
buses	O
that	O
cross	O
Jingguang	B-FAC
Bridge	I-FAC
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

As	O
buses	O
that	O
cross	O
the	B-FAC
Third	I-FAC
Ring	I-FAC
Road	I-FAC
are	O
currently	O
,	O
right	O
now	O
affected	O
by	O
the	O
Jingguang	B-FAC
Bridge	I-FAC
accident	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
latest	O
results	O
this	O
morning	O
show	O
that	O
32	B-CARDINAL
bus	O
routes	O
throughout	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
rerouted	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
perhaps	O
many	O
friends	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
are	O
wondering	O
how	O
one	B-CARDINAL
place	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
accommodate	O
32	B-CARDINAL
commuter	O
routes	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
accident	O
did	O
not	O
happen	O
,	O
perhaps	O
everyone	O
would	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
this	O

many	O
--	O

It	O
is	O
really	O

this	O

just	O

at	O
the	O

Right	O

Have	O
not	O

so	O
many	O

Its	O

on	O

has	O
been	O
extremely	O

a	O

,	O
this	O
is	O
because	O

It	O
is	O

a	O

How	O

Well	O

sometimes	O
under	O

sometimes	O

we	O

that	O
it	O

it	O
should	O

that	O

the	O

actually	O
for	O

that	O

more	B-CARDINAL

ah	O
,	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
big	O
city	O
,	O
a	O
suddenly	O
occurring	O
public	O
emergency	O
like	O
this	O
should	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
relatively	O
common	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
unexpected	O
yet	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
within	O
expectations	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
we	O
see	O
that	O
other	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
domestic	O
and	O
overseas	O
cities	O
have	O
experienced	O
similar	O
incidents	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
many	O
overseas	O
cities	O
have	O
had	O
such	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
before	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
a	O
city	O
is	O
a	O
gathering	O
place	O
for	O
modern	O
life	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
highly	O

as	O
well	O
as	O

however	O

in	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
at	O

The	O

the	O
critical	O
thing	O
is	O
how	O

are	O

after	O
the	O

of	O
such	O

and	O
for	O
a	O

I	O

The	O

Well	O
,	O
later	O

when	O
we	O

that	O

that	O

two	B-DATE

some	O

all	O

and	O
early	O

were	O
activated	O
in	O
quite	O
an	O
orderly	O
manner	O
.	O

From	O
our	O
perspective	O
as	O
media	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
precisely	O
by	O
going	O
through	O
those	O
breaking	O
-	O
in	O
,	O
trials	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
be	O
so	O
calm	O
in	O

such	O
an	O
emergency	O
today	B-DATE
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
everyone	O
the	O
most	O
effective	O
announcements	O
and	O
notifications	O
,	O
and	O
instructions	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
local	O
media	O
in	O
this	O
city	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
become	O
a	O
proactive	O
participant	O
when	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
public	O
emergency	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

It	O
should	O
play	O
its	O
individual	O
role	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
resolving	O
emergencies	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
apart	O
from	O
this	O
,	O
Professor	O
Zhou	B-PERSON
,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
are	O
the	O
areas	O
for	O
improvement	O
for	O
a	O
city	O
,	O
especially	O
a	O
booming	O
city	O
,	O
when	O
handling	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
public	O
emergency	O
?	O

Right	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
gave	O
us	O
many	O
revelations	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

First	B-ORDINAL
,	O
I	O
think	O
one	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
especially	O
important	O
is	O
early	O
warnings	O
and	O
forecasts	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
currently	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
frequently	O
various	O
kinds	O
of	O
risks	O
lurking	O
in	O
cities	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Early	O
warnings	O
and	O
forecasts	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
mechanism	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
sudden	O
road	O
cave	O
-	O
in	O
,	O
it	O
also	O
includes	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
security	O
incidents	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
society	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
natural	O
disasters	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
including	O
public	O
health	O
incidents	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
scientific	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
mechanism	O
must	O
be	O
set	O
up	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
manage	O
and	O
resolve	O
an	O
abnormal	O
situation	O
by	O
turning	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
normal	O
situation	O
,	O
without	O
evolving	O
into	O
a	O
sudden	O
public	O
emergency	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Another	O
thing	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
besides	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
emergency	O
response	O
and	O
speedy	O
integration	O
mechanisms	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
some	O
corresponding	O
improvements	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
release	O
of	O
information	O
,	O
incident	O
investigation	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
relevant	O
post-incident	O
,	O
responsibility	O
system	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
already	O
has	O
quite	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
relevant	O
systems	O
in	O
this	O
respect	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
an	O
administrative	O
investigation	O
system	O
for	O
incidents	O
of	O
major	O
responsibility	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
regulations	O
on	O
investigation	O
procedures	O
for	O
very	O
major	O
incidents	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
others	O
such	O
as	O
emergency	O
response	O
methods	O
for	O
handling	O
public	O
health	O
incidents	O
and	O
public	O
health	O
emergencies	O
,	O
among	O
others	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
many	O
corresponding	O
systems	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
question	O
is	O
how	O
city	O
management	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
handles	O
these	O
various	O
kinds	O
of	O
perhaps	O
unpredictable	O
cases	O
.	O

Since	O
we	O
are	O
entering	O
new	O
circumstances	O
of	O
human	O
living	O
,	O
circumstances	O
that	O
contain	O
high	O
risk	O
and	O
have	O
an	O
increasingly	O
developed	O
urbanized	O
life	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
corresponding	O
improvements	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
systems	O
that	O
includes	O
scientific	O
planning	O
,	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
,	O
emergency	O
response	O
,	O
accident	O
investigation	O
,	O
and	O
accountability	O
.	O

Um	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
understanding	O
of	O
the	O
situation	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
an	O
international	O
perspective	O
,	O
what	O
are	O
some	O
better	O
ways	O
of	O
urban	O
management	O
that	O
are	O
worthwhile	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
learn	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
,	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
urbanization	O
in	O
foreign	O
countries	O
developed	O
earlier	O
and	O
is	O
more	O
widespread	O
.	O

Their	O
level	O
of	O
development	O
is	O
more	O
advanced	O
than	O
ours	O
.	O

Although	O
the	O
scale	O
of	O
our	O
urbanization	O
is	O
currently	O
expanding	O
at	O
a	O
rate	O
of	O
1	B-PERCENT
%	I-PERCENT
per	O
year	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
economic	O
development	O
being	O
relatively	O
backward	O
,	O
we	O
actually	O
still	O
have	O
many	O
aspects	O
of	O
urban	O
management	O
to	O
learn	O
from	O
foreign	O
countries	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
pipes	O
involved	O
in	O
this	O

were	O
basic	O

With	O
a	O

of	O

,	O
how	O
can	O
the	O

strengthen	O

?	O

How	O
can	O
a	O
safe	O
,	O

be	O
established	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
learn	O
and	O
manage	O
this	O

Uh-huh	O

For	O

,	O
regarding	O
information	O

,	O
well	O
,	O
our	O
speed	O
of	O
information	O

this	O
time	O
was	O
very	O
fast	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
still	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
work	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
making	O
the	O

to	O
really	O
implement	O
a	O
system	O
of	O

of	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
need	O
to	O
explore	O
how	O

under	O

how	O

with	O
one	O

under	O
these	O

for	O

of	O

ah	O
,	O
how	O
will	O
these	O
emergency	O

withstand	O
these	O

We	O
know	O
that	O
currently	O

along	O
with	O

,	O
have	O
set	O
up	O
emergency	O

but	O
many	O

how	O

These	O

So	O

with	O
the	O

with	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
of	O
such	O

ah	O

I	O
think	O
there	O
will	O
be	O

That	O

How	O
can	O
we	O

The	B-ORG

Yes	O

Well	O
,	O
finally	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
turn	O
our	O
attention	O
to	O
handling	O
of	O
the	O
situation	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
latter	O
stages	O
of	O
the	O

Traffic	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
directed	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
basically	O
under	O
control	O
now	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
following	O
this	O
,	O
repairs	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
on	O
this	O
road	O
section	O
where	O
the	O
accident	O
occurred	O
,	O
including	O
for	O
many	O
pipes	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Yang	B-PERSON
Yang	I-PERSON
,	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
understanding	O
,	O
how	O
long	O
will	O
it	O
take	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
time	O
really	O
depends	O
on	O
how	O
the	O
overall	O
repair	O
goes	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
exploration	O
,	O
assessment	O
,	O
and	O
repair	O
are	O
carried	O
out	O
in	O
succession	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
regarding	O
this	O
work	O
progress	O
,	O
to	O
repair	O
this	O
road	O
section	O
in	O
the	O
shortest	O
time	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
this	O
will	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
work	O
progress	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
repair	O
is	O
probably	O
not	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
repairing	O
the	O
road	O
surface	O
alone	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
also	O
an	O
issue	O
with	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
pipes	O
below	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
the	O
pipes	O
below	O
.	O

Right	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
winter	O
,	O
we	O
know	O
that	O
carrying	O
out	O
construction	O
during	O
winter	O
,	O
especially	O
that	O
which	O
requires	O
pouring	O
concrete	O
and	O
then	O
--	O

Moreover	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
especially	O
difficult	O
for	O
concrete	O
to	O
set	O
during	O
winter	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
preparation	O
mix	O
for	O
making	O
it	O
dry	O
faster	O
,	O
has	O
already	O
been	O
added	O
.	O

But	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
it	O
requires	O
time	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
it	O
depends	O
very	O
much	O
on	O
factors	O
like	O
temperature	O
.	O

Just	O
now	O
,	O
you	O
mentioned	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
pipes	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
key	O
heating	O
pipeline	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
is	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
connected	O
in	O
time	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
waste	O

is	O
also	O
very	O
important	O

and	O
,	O
for	O

ah	O

,	O
right	O
now	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
optical	O

break	O
,	O
people	O
in	O
many	O

Yes	O

At	O

,	O
we	O

not	O

a	O

They	O
are	O

It	O
is	O
just	O
that	O

as	O
the	O
other	O

to	O
be	O
repaired	O
,	O
the	O
optical	O

it	O

After	O
that	O

it	O

that	O
a	O

I	O
always	O

these	O

but	O
uh	O
do	O
you	O

it	O
's	O
getting	O
the	O
attention	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
/?	O

Yeah	O
/.	O

No	O
because	O
to	O
me	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
whole	O
ballgame	O
of	O
the	O
Bush	B-PERSON
administration	O
/.	O

Katrina	B-EVENT
and	O
Rita	B-EVENT
they	O
'll	O
come	O
and	O
go	O

but	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
the	O
Bush	B-PERSON
administration	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
big	O
claim	O
um	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
go	O
to	O
Iraq	B-GPE
um	O
and	O
produce	O
a	O
decent	O
forward	O
looking	O

there	O

If	O
that	O
happens	O
then	O
I	O
think	O
President	O

is	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
huge	O
quiver	O
you	O

uh	O

Um	O
if	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
happen	O
I	O
think	O
uh	O
the	O
administration	O
will	O
be	O
seen	O
as	O
a	O
complete	O
and	O
utter	O
failure	O
/.	O

so	O
everything	O
rides	O
on	O
this	O
not	O
just	O
for	O
the	O

though	O

for	O
the	O
American	B-NORP
people	O
/.	O

These	O
are	O
huge	O
stakes	O
involved	O
/.	O

And	O
so	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
gotten	O
the	O
attention	O
it	O
's	O
deserved	O
/.	O

And	O
going	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
your	O
Iraq	B-GPE
collumns	O
uh	O
you	O
observed	O
the	O
Iraqi	B-NORP

which	O
after	O
all	O
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
increasingly	O
shouldering	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

/.	O

The	O
slightly	O
ragged	O
quality	O
left	O
you	O

you	O

you	O

the	O

That	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O

better	O
off	O
working	O
within	O
the	O
framework	O
of	O
the	O
six	B-CARDINAL

you	O

I	O
simply	O
do	O

So	O
the	O
problem	O
here	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O

between	O

the	O

James	B-PERSON

there	O
's	O
a	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
Arabs	B-NORP

this	O

What	O
is	O
the	O
pressure	O
on	O

Well	O

I	O

they	O

iron	O
out	O
any	O

So	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
preparatory	O
exercise	O
to	O
reach	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
agreement	O
beforehand	O
.	O

Of	O

,	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
not	O
all	O
Arab	B-NORP

speaking	O
again	O
with	O
one	B-CARDINAL

What	O
do	O
they	O
hope	O
to	O
achieve	O
?	O
and	O
what	O
can	O
you	O
claim	O
from	O
the	O
statements	O
made	O

?	O

It	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
Arab	B-NORP
's	O

have	O
traditionally	O
been	O
exercises	O
in	O

We	O
have	O
already	O

from	O
Libyan	B-NORP

Muammar	B-PERSON
Gaddafi	I-PERSON
on	O

what	O
he	O

a	O
draft	O

for	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O

on	O
Sunday	B-DATE
.	O

And	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
categorical	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
weak	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
harm	O
Israeli	B-NORP

sufficiently	O

So	O
we	O
have	O
Gadafi	B-PERSON
on	O
the	O
one	B-CARDINAL

On	O
the	O
other	O

we	O
have	O
Egypt	B-GPE
which	O
was	O
the	O
first	B-ORDINAL
Arab	B-NORP
country	O
to	O
make	O
peace	O
with	O
the	O
Jewish	B-NORP

which	O
is	O

also	O
a	O

The	O
Egyptian	B-NORP

more	O

Mr.	O

you	O

He	O
has	O
invested	O
an	O

Israel	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
really	O
he	O
can	O
not	O
afford	O
to	O
let	O
it	O
fail	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
seen	O
some	O
more	O
power	O
techniques	O
perhaps	O
from	O
his	O
Foreign	O

over	O

Amre	B-PERSON

today	B-DATE
at	O
the	O

Israel	B-GPE
and	O
the	O
two	B-CARDINAL

So	O
Egypt	B-GPE
is	O
playing	O
a	O

role	O

It	O
will	O
not	O
want	O
to	O

anything	O

What	O

the	O

Is	O
there	O

Well	O
,	O
actually	O
President	O
Mubarak	B-PERSON
was	O
very	O
categorical	O
today	B-DATE
in	O
condemning	O
calls	O
for	O
war	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
were	O
very	O
serious	O
and	O
people	O
should	O
understand	O
the	O
implications	O
of	O
just	O
what	O
it	O
meant	O
.	O

Egypt	B-GPE
and	O
Jordan	B-GPE
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
conventional	O
war	O
against	O
Israel	B-GPE
.	O

They	O
have	O
both	O
invested	O
enormous	O
amounts	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
both	O
regimes	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
vulnerable	O
if	O
the	O
peace	O
process	O
were	O
to	O
fail	O
,	O
because	O
detractors	O

opponents	O
within	O

country	O
would	O
have	O
ammunition	O
by	O
which	O
to	O

How	O
much	O
is	O
the	B-GPE

entering	O

and	O
how	O

seems	O
to	O
be	O
coming	O
from	O
the	B-GPE
United	I-GPE

?	O

Well	O
today	O
not	O
too	O
much	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
Madeleine	B-PERSON
Albright	I-PERSON
was	O
in	O
Saudi	B-GPE

yesterday	B-DATE
where	O
she	O

Interestingly	O
enough	O
she	O
is	O

telling	O
General	O

back	O
to	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
that	O

Nonetheless	O
,	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O

it	O
