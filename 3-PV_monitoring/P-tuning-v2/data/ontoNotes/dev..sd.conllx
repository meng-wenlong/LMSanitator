one	O
thing	O
we	O

what	O
we	O

just	O
look	O

a	O
conclusion	O

this	O

What	O
we	O
want	O
to	O

the	O

and	O
when	O
we	O

the	O

and	O
what	O
we	O
're	O
able	O
to	O
tell	O
from	O
this	O
individual	O
is	O
that	O
he	O
died	O
in	O

he	O

we	O

So	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
question	O
is	O
when	O

there	O

the	O

Also	O
the	O

it	O
that	O
was	O
cleaned	O

I	O

a	O
bad	O
position	O
trying	O
to	O
play	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
doing	O
+an	O
amazing	O
job	O
/.	O

Larry	B-PERSON
so	O
uh	O
any	O
chance	O
now	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
things	O
have	O
been	O
cleaned	O
up	O
et	O

to	O
get	O
any	O
usable	O
evidence	O
/?	O

Well	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
difficult	O
Dan	B-PERSON
/.	O

Uh	O
obviously	O
as	O
we	O
keep	O
saying	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
a	O
body	O
/.	O

therefore	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
a	O
cause	O
or	O
a	O
manner	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
/.	O

But	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
some	O
physical	O
evidence	O
/.	O

Unfortunately	O
examination	O
of	O
the	O
photograph	O
uh	O
tells	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
done	O
the	O
proper	O
way	O
/.	O

It	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
forensic	O
photograph	O
/.	O

So	O
I	O
really	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
large	O
the	O
stain	O
was	O
in	O
its	O
dimensions	O
/.	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
pretty	O
clear	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
blood	O
there	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
blood	O
/.	O

It	O
makes	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
something	O
criminal	O
occured	O
/.	O

But	O
again	O
getting	O
back	O
to	O
how	O
you	O
solve	O
the	O
crime	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O

scene	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
are	O
multiple	O
scenes	O
here	O

Every	O
place	O
there	O
's	O
blood	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
crime	O

/.	O

But	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
place	O
is	O
the	O
cabin	O
because	O
that	O
's	O
presumably	O
where	O
the	O

uh	O
that	O

that	O
the	O

According	O

Mr.	O
Hassan	B-PERSON
Nasrallah	I-PERSON
talked	O
about	O
outside	O

for	O
the	O
government	O

The	O
government	O
claims	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
outside	O
influence	O
on	O
its	O
decisions	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
West	B-GPE
says	O
that	O
the	O
Lebanese	B-NORP
government	O
is	O
a	O
Western	B-NORP
project	O
.	O

How	O
do	O
you	O
read	O
this	O
equation	O
?	O

Regardless	O
of	O
what	O
the	O
Lebanese	B-NORP
government	O
says	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
obvious	O
positions	O
from	O
Israel	B-GPE
and	O
from	O
the	O
new	O
conservatives	O
in	O
the	B-GPE
United	I-GPE
States	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
America	I-GPE
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

They	O
use	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
internal	O
contradiction	O
in	O
Lebanon	B-GPE
regarding	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
the	O
authority	O
and	O
regarding	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
the	O
authority	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
as	O
an	O
entrance	O
and	O
a	O
means	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
attack	O
on	O
the	O
region	O
and	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
scheme	O
of	O
the	O
neo-conservatives	O
,	O
who	O
suffered	O
several	O

kept	O
falling	O

one	O

So	O
you	O
find	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
re-fix	O
and	O
produce	O
their	O
project	O
in	O
the	O
region	O
,	O
maybe	O
it	O
would	O
reflect	O
on	O
the	O
American	B-NORP
inside	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
abort	O
ah	O
ah	O
the	O
report	O

Ah	O

Yes	O

So	O
,	O
this	O
plan	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
using	O
the	O
Lebanese	B-NORP
front	O
,	O
and	O
using	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
Lebanese	B-NORP

,	O
whether	O
it	O
wanted	O
or	O
not	O

to	O
be	O

of	O
the	O

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
,	O
can	O
we	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
insistence	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
governing	O
team	O
not	O
to	O
step	O
down	O
,	O
the	O
reason	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
its	O
position	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
outside	O
support	O
for	O
it	O
?	O

It	O
is	O
obvious	O
to	O
you	O
this	O
issue	O
has	O
become	O
obvious	O
for	O
everyone	O
,	O
especially	O
after	O
some	O
Arab	B-NORP
countries	O
entered	O
the	O
battlefield	O
in	O
Lebanon	B-GPE
in	O
an	O
obvious	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
considered	O
themselves	O
the	O
concerned	O
party	O
with	O
that	O
struggle	O
and	O
threat	O
by	O
sending	O
troops	O
to	O
Lebanon	B-GPE
to	O
fight	O
in	O
defense	O
of	O
that	O
situation	O

We	O
consider	O
that	O
heating	O
up	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
Lebanese	B-NORP
government	O
,	O
especially	O
that	O
the	O
will	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
heading	O
in	O

creating	O

of	O
a	B-ORG
Coalition	I-ORG
Government	I-ORG

Yes	O

The	O
intention	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
exclude	O
anyone	O
,	O
neither	O
to	O
isolate	O
anyone	O

The	O
intention	O
is	O
to	O
form	O
a	O

participation	O
to	O
protect	O
the	O
main	O

the	O

We	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O

So	O
do	O
we	O
know	O
right	O
now	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
new	O
progress	O
in	O
the	O

or	O
I	O
should	O

that	O
the	O

I	O
should	O
say	O

being	O

right	O
now	O

Right	O
now	O
a	O

Currently	O

now	O

Uh-huh	O

Judging	O

these	B-DATE

for	O

,	O
in	O

to	O
the	O
expansion	O
of	O
your	O

you	O

Therefore	O
in	O
this	O

it	O

not	O

a	O

in	O

This	O

we	O

for	O

I	O

the	O

is	O
a	O

that	O
Chery	B-ORG

Of	O

together	O
let	O
us	O

that	O
Chery	B-ORG

and	O
wish	O
that	O
China	B-GPE
would	O
stand	O
out	O
from	O
the	O

I	O

your	O

this	O

that	O
there	O
is	O
half	O

What	O
does	O
this	O
mean	O

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
ah	O
,	O
can	O
agree	O
.	O

Can	O
you	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

The	O
reason	O
is	O
because	O
we	O
two	B-QUANTITY
actually	O
have	O
very	O
,	O
very	O
,	O
different	O
personalities	O

Eh	O

Because	O
in	O
actual	O

we	O
well	O
complement	O
each	O

.	O

Oh	O
.	O

Er	O
,	O
ordinary	O
people	O
would	O
think	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
probably	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
more	O
heedless	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
,	O
uh	O
,	O
maybe	O
I	O
appear	O
more	O
careful	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

Actually	O
,	O
we	O
two	B-QUANTITY
are	O
the	O
exact	O

,	O
he	O
is	O
very	O
careful	O
,	O
very	O
careful	O
.	O

Oh	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
am	O
careless	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
put	O
something	O
away	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
lost	O
or	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
missing	O

Like	O
me	O
,	O
this	O
,	O
many	O
,	O
this	O
--	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
two	B-QUANTITY
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
complement	O
each	O
other	O
very	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

Like	O
in	O
the	O
troupe	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
I	O
actually	O
decide	O
the	O
general	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
troupe	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

for	O
instance	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
decide	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
troupe	O
will	O
proceed	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
the	O
one	O
who	O
focuses	O
on	O
this	O
big	O
direction	O
.	O

Oh	O
.	O

Usually	O
,	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
matter	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
production	O
side	O
,	O
like	O
this	O
,	O
oh	O
.	O

Eh	O
,	O
but	O
whenever	O
it	O
pertains	O
to	O
the	O
details	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
detailed	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
is	O
very	O
clear	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

I	O
heard	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Lai	B-PERSON
will	O
even	O
slice	O
cabbage	O
very	O
finely	O
and	O
delicately	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

Very	O
much	O
so	O
,	O

everything	O
he	O
does	O
,	O
he	O
wants	O
the	O
ambience	O
to	O
be	O
just	O
so	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
particular	O
about	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
,	O
very	O
particular	O
.	O

He	O
cooks	O
,	O
we	O
both	O
like	O
to	O
cook	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
cook	O
,	O
I	O
cook	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
cook	O
under	O
any	O
circumstance	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
cooks	O
,	O
he	O
needs	O
to	O
put	O
on	O
the	O
music	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
light	O
,	O
the	O
music	O
.	O

Like	O
this	O
--	O

Oh	O
yes	O
,	O
so	O
when	O
he	O
cooks	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
troublesome	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

A	O
mentally	O
ill	O
person	O
can	O
do	O
some	O
terrible	O
things	O
,	O
right	O
.	O

He	O
may	O
kill	O
other	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
bear	O
any	O
legal	O
responsibilities	O
.	O

So	O
what	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
.	O

Hence	O
the	O
entire	O
police	O
,	O
the	O
entire	O
social	O
system	O
should	O
begin	O
to	O
monitor	O
the	O
mental	O
state	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
.	O

Oh	O
,	O
this	O
point	O
of	O
yours	O
reminds	O
me	O
of	O
that	O
situation	O
of	O
Foucault	B-PERSON
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
that	O
's	O
right	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
start	O
monitoring	O
mental	O
conditions	O
.	O

How	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
monitoring	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
mental	O
health	O
is	O
greatly	O
emphasized	O
in	O
schools	O
.	O

Er	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
hospitals	O
and	O
social	O
workers	O
in	O
the	O
community	O
,	O
right	O
.	O

Social	O
workers	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
extensively	O
visit	O
different	O
family	O
communities	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
whether	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
this	O
family	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
are	O
arguing	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
marital	O
discord	O
between	O
wife	O
and	O
husband	O
.	O

They	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
greatly	O
advocated	O
the	O
popularization	O
of	O
psychiatrists	O
.	O

So	O
do	O
you	O
remember	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Xu	B-PERSON
,	O
first	O
went	O
to	O
the	B-GPE
United	I-GPE
States	I-GPE
,	O
you	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O
Americans	B-NORP
were	O
so	O
abnormal	O
for	O
seeing	O
psychiatrists	O
even	O
for	O
minor	O
issues	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
society	O
like	O
theirs	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
all	O
that	O
unusual	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
psychiatrist	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
normalized	O
that	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
how	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
the	O
entire	O
community	O
keeps	O
monitoring	O
everyone	O
's	O
mental	O
state	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
what	O
all	O
investors	O
are	O
most	O
concerned	O
about	O
is	O
,	O
how	O
long	O
will	O
this	O
wave	O
,	O
this	O
trend	O
of	O
appreciation	O
last	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
to	O
enter	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
like	O
this	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
in	O
Hong	B-GPE
Kong	I-GPE
,	O
he	O
can	O
directly	O
invest	O
in	O
the	O
Renminbi	O
,	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
profitable	O
to	O
enter	O
the	O
market	O
right	O
now	O
.	O

Uh	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
appreciation	O
of	O
the	O
RMB	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
be	O
on	O
a	O
rising	O
trend	O
for	O
a	O
quite	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
come	O
,	O
because	O
this	O
is	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
,	O
this	O
,	O
conditions	O
of	O
savings	O
in	O
China	B-GPE
itself	O
.	O

And	O
behind	O
the	O
change	O
in	O
savings	O
is	O
a	O
factor	O
of	O
demographics	O
.	O

Right	O
now	O
in	O
China	B-GPE
's	O
,	O
this	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
a	O
relatively	O
large	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
population	O
are	O
young	O
adults	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
people	O
have	O
higher	O
savings	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
save	O
for	O
their	O
children	O
's	O
education	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
retirement	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
during	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
this	O
stage	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
the	O
high	O
savings	O
has	O
resulted	O
in	O
a	O
larger	O
surplus	O
in	O
China	B-GPE
's	O
regular	O
accounts	O
.	O

So	O
this	O
trend	O
will	O
last	O
for	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
time	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
issue	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
appreciation	O
right	O
now	O
should	O
be	O
viewed	O
as	O
a	O
gradual	O
appreciation	O
on	O
a	O
small	O
scale	O
.	O

So	O
right	O
now	O
if	O
you	O
ask	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
profitable	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
to	O
exchange	O
,	O
this	O
,	O
other	O
currencies	O
into	O
Renminbi	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
,	O
this	O
,	O
this	O
,	O
the	O

During	O
the	B-EVENT

,	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
my	O

So	O
the	O

then	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O

you	O

or	O
they	O
would	O

you	O

that	O

So	O
you	O
always	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
fighting	O
with	O
people	O
,	O
such	O
things	O
,	O

Why	O
was	O
that	O
?	O

Was	O
it	O
because	O
people	O
for	O

would	O
say	O
that	O
your	O

was	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
,	O
or	O
your	O

was	O
such	O

So	O
it	O
was	O

of	O
that	O

?	O

Right	O
,	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
it	O
was	O

that	O

Mm	O

Mm	O

Because	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
face	O
them	O
alone	O
,	O
OK	O
,	O
a	O

and	O
you	O
had	O

So	O
that	O
was	O

the	O
only	O
way	O
you	O

there	O

if	O

that	O

it	O

how	O

you	O

You	O
were	O
the	O
son	O

you	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
natural	O

the	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
perfectly	O

I	O

Those	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O
dare	O
defend	O

I	O
just	O

endure	O
it	O
for	O
quite	O
a	O

Finally	O
a	O
very	O

a	O

hit	O
me	O
on	O

I	O

In	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

So	O
then	O
I	O
ran	O
over	O

took	O
a	O
whack	O
at	O
the	O
door	O

to	O
get	O
an	O

Was	O

all	O
ruined	O

The	O
door	O

I	O
slashed	O

Um	O
,	O
was	O
n't	O
there	O
any	O

Mm	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

,	O
I	O
just	O
let	O
the	O
adults	O
reason	O
with	O
me	O

Mm	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
memory	O
from	O
your	O

It	O
,	O
had	O
a	O

on	O

Including	O
that	O

that	O

this	O

Mm	O

Mm	O
.	O

,	O
the	O
reason	O
I	O
like	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
it	O
brings	O
up	O
lots	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
childhood	O
memories	O

Mm	O
,	O
you	O
spent	O
a	O
large	O
part	O
of	O
your	O

in	O
Beijing	B-GPE

What	O
year	O
was	O
it	O
that	O
you	O

How	O

Mm	O

Mm	O
,	O
well	O

In	O
'69	B-DATE
at	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
11	B-DATE
you	O
went	O
from	O
Beijing	B-GPE
to	O
Shanghai	B-GPE
.	O

Mm	O
,	O
your	O
living	O
environment	O
changed	O
,	O
but	O
perhaps	O
that	O
mischievousness	O
had	O
n't	O
completely	O
passed	O

Mm	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
puts	O
it	O
,	O
looking	O
at	O
it	O
now	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
memories	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
painful	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
happy	O
days	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
every	O
day	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
suspended	O

I	O

it	O

This	O

really	O
helped	O
me	O
a	O

,	O
,	O
sometimes	O
in	O

about	O
this	O

That	O
period	O
was	O
both	O
a	O

the	O

,	O
they	O

If	O

at	O

in	O

They	O
just	O
were	O

it	O
was	O

a	O

we	O

for	O
several	B-DATE

In	O
those	O

if	O
a	O

how	O
did	O
he	O
go	O
about	O

Um	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
school	O
kid	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
Um	O
,	O
that	O
girl	O
,	O
who	O
ran	O
the	O
kitchen	O
and	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
better	O

in	O
our	O

,	O
I	O
liked	O
her	O

Mm	O

I	O
always	O
felt	O

um	O
,	O
she	O
can	O
,	O
give	O
you	O
more	O
on	O
your	O

,	O
put	O
more	O

on	O
your	O

for	O
you	O

And	O
then	O
the	O
most	O
obvious	O
way	O
was	O
um	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
see	O
a	O
movie	O
together	O
.	O

Mm	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
,	O

So	O
already	O
you	O
could	O
--	O
Go	O
see	O
a	O
movie	O
;	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O

That	O
was	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
it	O
.	O

You	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
see	O
the	O
movie	O
,	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
worry	O
about	O
holding	O
hands	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
great	O
,	O
--	O

So	O
you	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
movies	O
with	O
this	O
girl	O
?	O

Yes	O
.	O

Do	O
you	O
still	O
remember	O
what	O

you	O
saw	O
?	O

The	B-WORK_OF_ART

I	O
still	O
remember	O
that	O
now	O
.	O

Mm	O
.	O

She	O
cried	O
as	O
hard	O
as	O
she	O
could	O
.	O

So	O
seeing	O
The	B-WORK_OF_ART
Flower	I-WORK_OF_ART
Girl	I-WORK_OF_ART
was	O
the	O
equivalent	O
of	O
seeing	O
Titanic	B-WORK_OF_ART
now	O
.	O

Oh	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
a	O
bit	O
,	O
a	O
bit	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
all	O
was	O
ready	O
,	O
no	O
cry	O

Yes	O
,	O
crying	O
her	O
eyes	O
out	O
,	O
a	O
big	O

like	O
that	O

At	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
would	O
n't	O
cry	O

But	O
the	O
people	O
all	O
around	O
were	O
crying	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
cry	O
it	O
would	O
look	O
bad	O
.	O

So	O
then	O
you	O
cried	O
.	O

So	O
then	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
let	O
my	O
emotions	O
go	O
.	O

Um	O
,	O
how	O
was	O
the	O
girl	O
,	O
was	O
she	O
very	O
pretty	O
?	O

,	O
now	O
I	O

that	O
she	O
was	O

this	O

How	O
was	O
it	O
she	O
liked	O
you	O
?	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
two	B-CARDINAL
people	O
gave	O
each	O
other	O
the	O
eye	O
and	O
felt	O
it	O
was	O
right	O
,	O
then	O
,	O

Gave	O
each	O
other	O
the	O
eye	O
,	O
while	O
you	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
class	O
you	O
gave	O
each	O

the	O

,	O
so	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
in	O

for	O

you	O

I	O
remember	O
how	O

When	O
we	O
went	O

,	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
very	O

Mm	O

So	O
then	O

we	O
'd	O
each	O
pick	O
up	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O

and	O
toss	O
the	O

I	O
threw	O
it	O
at	O
someone	O

but	O
missed	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
hit	O
her	O

The	O
result	O
was	O
that	O
she	O
turned	O
her	O
head	O
to	O
look	O

And	O
she	O
looked	O
at	O
you	O
angrily	O

I	O
thought	O
,	O
uh-oh	O
,	O
the	O
expression	O
in	O
her	O

was	O
like	O
she	O
would	O

A	O
second	B-ORDINAL
problem	O
connected	O
